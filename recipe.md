masala pasta ingrediants are.....

1. bring 6 cups of water to a boil in large pot.when the water begins to boil,add salt and pasta.
2. cook the pasta on a medium flame.it should be soft yet cooked but not chewy.refer the package 
 for extract cook time as each brand has a different cook time.
 once done drain the pasta to a colander. you can use this towards the end to bring the pasta to 
 consistency.

4. add onions and fry until they turn golden.
5. add the chopped vegetable and dry for 2 to 3 minutes.
6. add mashed tomatoes along with salt. fry until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy. you can also 
 puree the tomatoes and use. most times i do puree them as my boys are super fussy with the skin
 of tomatoes.
7. when raw smell of tomatoes disappear, add kasuri methi,masala powder and red chili powder.
8.  fry for 1 or 2 minutes till the raw flavour of chili powder goes away. if using cream add it
 now.

10. toss well and  add coriander leaves. if it is too dry you can add little oil or pasta cooked 
 water. mix well and check salt.add more if needed.
